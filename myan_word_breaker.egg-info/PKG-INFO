Description: |This is the word segmentation tool for Myanmar text. Word segmentation is the process of determining word boundaries in a piece of text.|Word Segmentation is the most basic but very important step for Natural Language Processing of Myanmar Text. It is also non-trivial task since Myanmar text is a string of characters without explicit word boundary delimiters.|In this library, I use the method from the research paper of Ko Tun Thura Thet (2008) Word segmentation for the Myanmar Language. There is two phases in this method: syllable segmentation and syllable merging. A rule-based heuristic approach was adopted for syllable segmentation, and a dictionary-based statistical approach for syllable merging.
